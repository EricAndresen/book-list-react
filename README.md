# Book List App

This is a simple book list app based on the following spec, and [these requirements](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)

![Rows of books organized by whether they have been read or not](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/July/595d48a9_correct-use-of-state/correct-use-of-state.gif)

This is an assignment for my Udacity Front End Nano-degree. I chose to start from scratch building with React + Redux rather than use the template code usually provided. 

_Update: This project was originally rejected for using Redux. So I moved the old version into the `redux` branch and refactored to pass state down through components._

## Instructions

To see the app live, clone this directory to your local machine and cd into it. Then run `npm install` and `npm start` (or use yarn with the same commands). A window with the application should open automatically. Both branches should have identical performance.

The specification required /add to show no books by default. To see all available books type one space.

_Note: data is persisted with localStorage, state will be lost if cache is emptied_
