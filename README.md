# Book List App (in progress)

This is a simple book list app based on the following spec, and [these requirements](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)

![Rows of books organized by whether they have been read or not](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/July/595d48a9_correct-use-of-state/correct-use-of-state.gif)

This is an assignment for my Udacity Front End Nano-degree. I chose to start from scratch building with React + Redux rather than use the template code usually provided. 

## Instructions

To see the app live, clone this directory to your local machine and cd into it. Then run `npm install` and `npm start` (or use yarn with the same commands). A window with the application should open automatically. 

_Note: I didn't set up a backend for this project so information is not persisted_
